	Performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) backwards from a node, growing a single
	tree rooted at it. Each candidate is scored by its own isolated contribution
	along the branch it would create: score(C) = evaluate_path([C, leaf, ..., root]),
	i.e. the message C sends up the leaf->root chain, removed from the clean
	residual and passed to the metric. This is exactly the per-path contribution
	PathMessagePatching uses; the tree is the same set of paths materialised as a
	trie sharing common suffixes toward the root. No joint-ablation baseline is
	involved, so a candidate's score depends only on C and the chain above it, not
	on any sibling subtree.

	Set `joint_scoring=True` to score each candidate in the context of the tree instead: the
	contribution of attaching C under leaf L becomes the score of the whole tree with L relaying C's
	message, minus the score of that same tree with L contributing nothing. The candidate's message
	then merges with every other subtree's at the shared ancestors and at the metric, so a candidate
	whose effect is already carried by an admitted branch scores lower, and one that only matters in
	the presence of another scores higher. The tree is frozen for the whole depth, so candidates at a
	depth do not suppress one another (see :func:`_joint_scoring_context`).

	Note that joint scores are only valid for the tree that was in place when they were taken, so —
	unlike isolated scores — a run at a low threshold can no longer be pruned to reproduce a run at a

		min_contribution (float, default=0.5):
			The minimum absolute contribution required for a candidate to be attached to the tree.
		include_negative (bool, default=True):
			If True, include candidates with negative contributions. The min_contribution is therefore interpreted as a threshold on the magnitude of the contribution.
		joint_scoring (bool, default=False):
			If True, score each candidate in the context of the tree grown so far rather than in
			isolation. See the note above; this changes the meaning of min_contribution and disables
